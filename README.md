# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

This project provides a simple console-based visualization of common sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort. The program generates a random array of integers and visually demonstrates how each algorithm sorts the array step by step.

## Features

- Visual representation of sorting algorithms in action
- Supports three sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- Generates a random array of integers for sorting

## Requirements

- C++ Compiler (g++ recommended)
- C++11 or later

## How to Compile and Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SortingVisualizer.git
   cd SortingVisualizer
   ```
